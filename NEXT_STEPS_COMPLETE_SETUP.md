## üöÄ Next Steps to Complete Your Setup

### Step 1: Choose Your Tunnel Method

You have two excellent options to expose your ComfyUI to Railway:

#### **Option A: ngrok (Easiest Setup)**
- **Pros**: Quick setup, reliable
- **Cons**: Free tier has session limits
- **Best for**: Testing and development

#### **Option B: Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended)**
- **Pros**: Free, stable, faster, better security
- **Cons**: Slightly more setup
- **Best for**: Production use

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Option A: Using ngrok

#### 1. Install ngrok
1. Go to: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Download ngrok for Windows
3. Extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\ngrok\`)
4. Add `C:\ngrok` to your Windows PATH

#### 2. Setup ngrok
1. Sign up at https://ngrok.com
2. Get your authtoken from the dashboard
3. Run: `ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN`

#### 3. Start the tunnel
Run our automated script:
```bash
start_production_local.bat
```

This will:
- Start your ComfyUI (if not running)
- Create ngrok tunnel on port 8188
- Show you the public URL

#### 4. Copy the ngrok URL
Look for something like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

### Option B: Using Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended)

#### 1. Install Cloudflare CLI
1. Go to: https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest
2. Download `cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe`
3. Rename to `cloudflared.exe`
4. Create folder `C:\cloudflared\` and move file there
5. Add `C:\cloudflared` to your Windows PATH

#### 2. Test installation
Open Command Prompt and run:
```bash
cloudflared --version
```

#### 3. Start the tunnel
Run our automated script:
```bash
start_production_cloudflare.bat
```

This will:
- Start your ComfyUI (if not running)
- Create Cloudflare tunnel on port 8188
- Show you the public URL

#### 4. Copy the Cloudflare URL
Look for something like: `https://abc-def-ghi.trycloudflare.com`
