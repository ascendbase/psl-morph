# 🚀 SIMPLE SOLUTION - No Docker Build Required

## 🎯 **PROBLEM:**
- Your current endpoint uses FLUX models
- You need SD1.5 models (Real Dream + Chad LoRA)
- Docker build is taking too long or getting stuck

## 💡 **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:**

### **Option 1: Use Existing SD1.5 Endpoint**
Update your current endpoint to use a pre-built SD1.5 image:

1. Go to: https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless
2. Click on `miserable_amber_jackal` endpoint
3. Click "Edit" button
4. Change Docker Image from:
   ```
   timpletruskybilbla/runpod-worker-comfy:3.4.0-flux1-schnell
   ```
   To:
   ```
   runpod/worker-comfy:dev-cuda12.1.0
   ```
5. Save and wait 2-3 minutes for restart

### **Option 2: Create New SD1.5 Endpoint**
1. Go to RunPod Console → Serverless
2. Click "New Endpoint"
3. Use Docker image: `runpod/worker-comfy:dev-cuda12.1.0`
4. Set GPU: RTX 4090 or A100
5. Create endpoint

## 🔧 **Upload Your Models:**

After endpoint restart, you'll need to upload your models:

### **Method A: Via ComfyUI Interface**
1. Test your endpoint with a simple request
2. Access ComfyUI interface (if available)
3. Upload `real-dream-15.safetensors` to checkpoints
4. Upload `chad_sd1.5.safetensors` to loras

### **Method B: Via API Upload**
Use the client I created to upload models programmatically.

## 🧪 **Test Your Setup:**

Run this to test with your models:
```bash
python runpod_sd15_client.py
```

## ⚡ **Why This Works:**

- ✅ **No Docker build required** - uses pre-built image
- ✅ **SD1.5 compatible** - supports your Real Dream + Chad LoRA
- ✅ **Immediate deployment** - works in 2-3 minutes
- ✅ **Model upload** - can add your specific models after
- ✅ **Cost effective** - same serverless pricing

## 🎉 **Expected Result:**

After updating the endpoint:
1. **Endpoint restarts** with SD1.5 support
2. **Upload your models** via interface or API
3. **Test generation** with Real Dream + Chad LoRA
4. **Working face morphing** with your specific models

## 🔍 **If Still Having Issues:**

The Docker build is running in the background. If it completes successfully, you can use that custom image instead. But this simple solution should work immediately without waiting for the build.

**Next Step:** Try Option 1 above while the Docker build continues in the background.
