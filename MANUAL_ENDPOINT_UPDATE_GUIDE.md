# ðŸ”§ MANUAL RUNPOD ENDPOINT UPDATE GUIDE

## ðŸŽ¯ **GOAL:** Update your endpoint to use your custom face morphing models

Your current endpoint `miserable_amber_jackal` (qgbwisnbyjqw2n) is using the wrong Docker image. We need to change it to use your custom image with the face morphing models.

---

## ðŸ“‹ **STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:**

### **Step 1: Access RunPod Console**
1. Open your browser and go to: https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless
2. Log in with your RunPod account

### **Step 2: Find Your Endpoint**
1. Look for the endpoint named: **`miserable_amber_jackal`**
2. It should show ID: `qgbwisnbyjqw2n`
3. Current status should be "Ready"

### **Step 3: Edit the Endpoint**
1. Click on the **`miserable_amber_jackal`** endpoint
2. Click the **"Edit"** button (usually in the top right)
3. You'll see the endpoint configuration page

### **Step 4: Update Docker Image**
1. Find the **"Docker Image"** field
2. Current value: `timpletruskybilbla/runpod-worker-comfy:3.4.0-flux1-schnell`
3. **CHANGE IT TO:** `ascendbase/face-morphing-comfyui:latest`
4. Make sure there are no extra spaces

### **Step 5: Optional - Update Name**
1. You can also change the name from `miserable_amber_jackal` to something like:
   - `face-morphing-endpoint`
   - `chad-morph-endpoint`
   - Or keep the current name

### **Step 6: Save Changes**
1. Click **"Save"** or **"Update Endpoint"**
2. The endpoint will start restarting
3. Status will change to "Updating" or "Starting"

### **Step 7: Wait for Restart**
1. **WAIT 2-3 MINUTES** for the endpoint to fully restart
2. Status should return to "Ready"
3. The Docker image should now show: `ascendbase/face-morphing-comfyui:latest`

## âœ… **WHAT THIS GIVES YOU:**

After the update, your endpoint will have:
- âœ… **Real Dream checkpoint model** - High quality base model
- âœ… **Chad LoRA model** - Face morphing transformations
- âœ… **ComfyUI with face morphing workflow** - Complete setup
- âœ… **All necessary dependencies** - Ready to use

---

## ðŸ§ª **AFTER UPDATE - TEST IT:**

Once the endpoint shows "Ready" status again, run this command to test:

```bash
python test_new_endpoint_with_wait.py
```

This should now work with your face morphing models!

---

## ðŸš¨ **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **If you can't find the Edit button:**
- Make sure you're the owner of the endpoint
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if you're in the correct RunPod account

### **If the Docker image field is read-only:**
- Some endpoints might be locked
- Try creating a new endpoint with the correct image instead

### **If the endpoint fails to start:**
- The Docker image might be pulling (downloading)
- Wait 5-10 minutes for the first time
- Check the logs for any error messages

---

## ðŸ“ž **NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Update the endpoint** following the steps above
2. **Wait for it to restart** (2-3 minutes)
3. **Test with:** `python test_new_endpoint_with_wait.py`
4. **If successful:** Your face morphing is ready!
5. **If still failing:** Let me know the exact error message

The key is changing that Docker image from the current one to `ascendbase/face-morphing-comfyui:latest` which contains all your face morphing models.
