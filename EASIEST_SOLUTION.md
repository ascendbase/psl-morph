# Easiest Solution: Use RunPod Web Terminal

Since SSH is giving us trouble, let's use the simplest approach - RunPod's built-in web terminal.

## Step 1: Access RunPod Web Terminal
1. **Go to your RunPod dashboard**
2. **Click on your pod** (the RTX 5090 one)
3. **Look for "Terminal" or "Web Terminal" button**
4. **Click it** - this opens a browser-based terminal

## Step 2: Start ComfyUI with External Access
In the web terminal, run:
```bash
cd /workspace/ComfyUI
python main.py --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8188 --enable-cors-header
```

## Step 3: Check for Public URL
Look in your RunPod dashboard for:
- **"Public URL"** 
- **"HTTP Endpoints"**
- **"Exposed Ports"**
- Any URL that looks like: `https://something-8188.proxy.runpod.net`

## Step 4: Update Your App
If you find a public URL, update your `.env` file:
```env
RUNPOD_POD_URL=your-public-url-here
RUNPOD_POD_PORT=443
```

## Step 5: Run Your App
```bash
python app.py
```

## Why This Works Better:
- ✅ **No SSH needed** - uses browser
- ✅ **No key issues** - direct web access
- ✅ **Simpler setup** - just click buttons
- ✅ **More reliable** - RunPod's built-in solution

## Alternative: Manual Port Forwarding
If RunPod doesn't provide public URLs, you might need to:
1. **Contact RunPod support** to expose port 8188
2. **Use a different cloud GPU provider** that allows direct port access
3. **Use RunPod serverless** instead of pods (different pricing model)

The web terminal approach is the most reliable way to get this working quickly!
